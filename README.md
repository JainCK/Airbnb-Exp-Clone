# Airbnb Experience Clone

This project is a clone of the Airbnb experience page, built as part of my learning journey. I used Vite, a fast build tool, to set up the project and explore its capabilities.

## Learning Focus

- **Vite:** The project is scaffolded using Vite, a build tool that offers lightning-fast development setup. This allowed me to focus more on the code and less on setup.
  
- **Props and Mapping Data:** Throughout the project, I delved into React concepts like props and data mapping. Understanding how to pass and manage data between components was a key learning outcome.
